# Chroma heatmap
## Disclaimer
This project is developed and tested on Razer Black Widow chroma X, on Windows 10 x64.
There are bugs:
- The library used for detecting the keystrokes, does not detect the Fn key.
- Works only on Windows 10.
- No exit, excepty ctrl+c
- You need to install Connect from Razer synapse to be able to connect to the SDK.

I will add some other functionalities later.
